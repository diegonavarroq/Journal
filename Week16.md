# Week 16: Personal Brand

This week I was supposed to have my first mock interview, this one to see how far my knowledge goes on some important topics for computer science interviews. This week I had a surprise interview with an Encora client, it seemed to me that it went well, but I did get a little nervous when I was solving a problem.

### White board interview

This week I watched a video about a Google interview where a person solves a problem by writing code or pseudocode on a white board. I learned that there are some things that you have to do when you have an interview like that.

- Ask as many clarifying questions as necessary to solve the problem.
- It's a good idea to think about possible solutions out loud to make it easier for the interviewer to see how you solve problems.
- Propose a quick solution and later you see what improvements you can make.
- If possible test your solution.
- The most important thing BE CONFIDENT.


### HashMap

I also learned how to use a new data structure called HashMap, this consists of an ordinary array combined with a hash function. A hash function receives a data of any type and returns a number, this number will be the index in which it will be stored inside the array. This means that this structure is of the key-value type, you give the hash function the key and it returns the index of the value in the array, so access is instantaneous.


This week was full of review more than new learning, I was reviewing some concepts of object-oriented programming, data structures and sorting algorithms. I've been troubleshooting hackerrank more than anything because I feel like I'm a bit rusty on that. This week I will try to use a method that I read on the internet that consists of trying to understand the problem in 15 minutes, implement a solution in 15 minutes and test and fix in another 15 minutes.
