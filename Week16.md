# Week 16: Personal Brand

This week I was supposed to have my first mock interview, this one to see how far my knowledge goes on some important topics for computer science interviews. This week I had a surprise interview with an Encora client, it seemed to me that it went well, but I did get a little nervous when I was solving a problem.

### White board interview

This week I watched a video about a Google interview where a person solves a problem by writing code or pseudocode on a white board. I learned that there are some things that you have to do when you have an interview like that.

- Ask as many clarifying questions as necessary to solve the problem.
- It's a good idea to think about possible solutions out loud to make it easier for the interviewer to see how you solve problems.
- Propose a quick solution and later you see what improvements you can make.
- If possible test your solution.
- The most important thing BE CONFIDENT.
