## Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software

A book that begins with fairly simple and easy-to-understand concepts that at first it even made me somewhat boring. But as it progresses, more and more complexity is added to the matter, until you end up building a fully functional computer and you realize that you began in a quest to transmit information through the on and off of a simple lamp using the famous Morse code.

This book did solve some of the doubts that I had about the operation of some systems inside the computer such as access to memory, it seemed to me something that it was necessary to be a specialist on the subject to understand it but in this book, they put it to you a very simple way. All you have to do is scale things to how are they now. 

With the simple example that it is necessary to communicate with your neighbor in a silent way, it is when the common and ordinary lamp that we all have in our homes is used and it begins to describe in a very basic way the use of codes such as morse and braille. From there it jumps to the zeros and ones and everything that can be done with them, which are also known as bits the smallest unit that can represent information. 

The power of the bits combined with an arrangement of electrical circuits is what gives rise to the ability to do things like basic operations in an autonomous way and also the ability to remember what comes out of those calculations. These circuits multiplied by millions is what gives rise to the processors and memory inside our computer.

All this in combination with the software is what brings these components to life and gives them the ability to do things as specific as receiving input from this keyboard and allowing me to do my assignments of the month. 

Although this book has been written for more than 20 years, it is still quite current and precise in what it describes, until now computers continue to work in the same way the only difference is that now they are much more powerful, I recommend this book to any developer or any person in general not because it is strictly necessary but only to fully understand how the main tool in which he work works. 

### Learnings:
- How low-level systems inside a computer works. 
- How the components interact. 
- Meaning of code. 
- Manipulation of information at a bit level. 
- A little bit of electronics. 
- Logic gates. 
- Computers are the same as 20 years ago.
