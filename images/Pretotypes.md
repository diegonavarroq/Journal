## Didasko3001

### Description

It is a teaching-learning platform, it consists in that if you want to learn some specific knowledge for free, the only thing you have to give in return is a specific knowledge in the form of a course. For this, whoever wants to teach must design a course with the following; name, objective, duration, content and evaluation criteria. Anyone who wants to learn can search in categories for the course he wants. You will only have access to the courses once you have uploaded your course. This course may be on any subject, but it has to be of some specific knowledge. In order to be taught, each course must be authorized by a commission and the participant, upon approval, will be able to download the certificate. They will be offered by general themes such as programming, languages, design, mechanics, etc. Within these themes will be the specific courses.

### Hypothesis

This teaching platform will allow anyone with internet access to achieve quality education in subjects of their specific interest, with the condition of teaching some specific knowledge in return.

### Experiment description

The objective of the experimentation is to check whether the idea is viable for further development. The first part consisted of conducting a survey in which people rated the idea in a rating from 1 to 5, with the option of a comment box where they could give their opinions and suggestions.

The second part was to make a mockup of the possible final design of the application and in this case simulate its operation to see if people would actually use it as part of their daily lives.

### Validation

With this program, it will be possible to stimulate both the learning process of a person and their ability to teach others, which constitutes a complete cycle of teaching-learning in which the person manages to train in an integral way, which in turn will allow them to carry out to practice what has been learned, and to provide feedback on the theory.


## Cerberos3002

### Description

It is a mobile application that consists of facilitating access to residential areas through the use of existing cameras in the access points, they will be used as a vision system that will read the plates of the cars and depending on the status in the application it will give access or not. Its operation is as follows, all residents will have the application downloaded on their mobile devices where they will register as residents, part of the registration is to enter the license plate of your car so that it can be identified by the vision system. In the event that you expect visits, you will be able to register them with the visit status and the plate in the car in which they will go, the visit status consists of access for a limited time to the residential. In the event that you go to someone else's car or the entrance is pedestrian, the application will have a button only to open the door, this button also works for delivery services or cars that do not need to be registered because its access will be only one time.

### Hypothesis

This vehicle license plate reading application will allow residents of private subdivisions to keep an access control of their own and other people's vehicles, safe and economical. Avoiding the use of manual controls, magnetic cards and calls to give access.

### Experiment description

The objective of the experimentation is to check whether the idea is viable for further development. The first part consisted of conducting a survey in which people rated the idea in a rating from 1 to 5, with the option of a comment box where they could give their opinions and suggestions.

The second part was to make a mockup of the possible final design of the application and in this case simulate its operation to see if people would actually use it as part of their daily lives.

### Validation

With this program that will allow entry to residential gates through license plate reading, it is intended to achieve greater control and, therefore, greater security for the resident, compared to traditional entry control systems that can be ineffective and inefficient because when sharing a door password, magnetic card, etc. control of whoever accesses the residential may be lost.


## Asclepio3003

### Description

It is a decentralized technology that will be present in all hospitals which will contain people's medical records. This can be consulted both by the patient's doctor and by the patient himself. In the event that the patient is receiving some medical treatment or is admitted to the hospital, he may be seeing in real time all the updates that are being made to his medical record, such as the diagnosis, treatment, cost and medications. That are being supplied to you, all this in real time. It may also be consulted by insurance agents for medical expenses.

### Hypothesis

This application will allow any doctor from any hospital, as well as the patient, to know in real time their medical history, diagnosis, procedures, treatment and the costs generated by the care received. This will achieve transparency in all medical procedures that are carried out.

### Experiment description

In the case of this idea, it only consisted of conducting a survey in which people rated the idea in a rating from 1 to 5, with the option of a comment box where they could give their opinions and suggestions.

And I also asked a family member who happened to have just had surgery and who had an opinion about this idea given his experience in a hospital recently.

The importance of this technology lies mainly in the fact that patients should be properly informed and there is clarity in the procedures or treatments they are receiving, as well as in the certainty that they are adequately cared, for hospital centers will be able to have greater control over the use of their resources, their spaces and the work of their staff by having everything duly registered and updated, which will surely impact intra-hospital life. Meanwhile, medical insurance companies will be able to streamline their procedures for both planned and unforeseen authorizations as well as the reimbursements that frequently have to be made to their clients. This technology could generate great benefits to both national and international private and public health services.
