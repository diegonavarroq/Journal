# Week 15: Personal Brand

This week a new phase of the apprentice called “Your Personal Brand” began, which consists of developing certain skills that will be necessary for future interviews and writing an attractive CV for companies. Solving exercises on algorithms and data structures are a big part of this phase since most interviews for developers come with exercises of this type to see how good the candidates are at solving problems.

One of the assignments of this phase is to read a book called "Cracking the coding interview" that explains how the interview process is from the perspective of an interviewer and how they evaluate candidates, what they seek to find depending on the type of question they ask.

On the other hand, it also shows you what a candidate's experience is like when they go through the recruitment process in various companies and what you have to focus on depending on the company you apply to.

So far in this book, he also advises interviewers on how to treat candidates so that they feel more confident and comfortable while interviewing, so that they can perform at their best in an environment that is known to be challenging and a bit tense.

Apart from the book that was not commissioned to be read for this phase, I am also reading a book on algorithms and data structures. I already had previous knowledge about some data structures, how they work and how they are structured, but what I had not seen is that there are specific algorithms for searching for information within these data structures.

This week I learned about a data structure that I had not seen, this one is called graph and so far I know two types of graph: unweighted and weighted, the main difference is that weighted graphs assign a value to the path that goes from one node to another and the unweighted do not.
