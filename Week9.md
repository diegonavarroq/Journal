# Week 9 

This was the last week of the building something from scratch phase, I continued working on the project for the client, it was almost finished in its entirety, what we were doing was finishing some functionalities and correcting some of the bugs that were presented as we were testing the application. These bugs were related to the responsiveness of the UI depending on the device in which it was being tested, for example, if you opened the application in the browser of an iPhone everything would be seen correctly, but if you opened it in the browser of an Android device some components were out of place or not deployed as expected. I think I can speak on behalf of my team when I say that we were very satisfied with what we delivered in the final demo since at the beginning of the project the work that we had to develop further being from scratch was too broad, but in the end the results were obtained. expected results for us, the client and the staff.

This week I learned a little more about React Native and JS in general, a colleague used a tool called asyncstorage in this case it was used to store the token that came from the backend when logging in, this token is used in various screens of the application to validate the user, then with asyncstorage you already have it globally throughout the application.

Due to time I did not have the opportunity to contribute directly to the backend code, but I did have the opportunity to interact directly, having cloned the repository and doing tests between the backend and the frontend locally on my computer, to make sure that the communication between both were correct. I also used the postman app quite a bit when I was connecting some screens functionalities. Postman helped me to see in an easier way the information that I had to send him and how he had to send it to the backend and what he had to return to me and how.
