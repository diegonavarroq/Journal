# Week 9 

This was the last week of the building something from scratch phase, I continued working on the project for the client, it was almost finished in its entirety, what we were doing was finishing some functionalities and correcting some of the bugs that were presented as we were testing the application. These bugs were related to the responsiveness of the UI depending on the device in which it was being tested, for example, if you opened the application in the browser of an iPhone everything would be seen correctly, but if you opened it in the browser of an Android device some components were out of place or not deployed as expected. I think I can speak on behalf of my team when I say that we were very satisfied with what we delivered in the final demo since at the beginning of the project the work that we had to develop further being from scratch was too broad, but in the end the results were obtained. expected results for us, the client and the staff.

This week I learned a little more about React Native and JS in general, a colleague used a tool called asyncstorage in this case it was used to store the token that came from the backend when logging in, this token is used in various screens of the application to validate the user, then with asyncstorage you already have it globally throughout the application.

Due to time I did not have the opportunity to contribute directly to the backend code, but I did have the opportunity to interact directly, having cloned the repository and doing tests between the backend and the frontend locally on my computer, to make sure that the communication between both were correct. I also used the postman app quite a bit when I was connecting some screens functionalities. Postman helped me to see in an easier way the information that I had to send it and how it had to send it to the backend and what it had to return to me and how.

I learned what deeplinking is, it would have been good to add this functionality to the application, but due to time we did not have the opportunity to implement it. There was a particular use that I wanted to give it and it was that when you received an invitation to join the application, you would receive a link to your email that would take you directly to the signup screen. The functionality of receiving a link to your email is working, but it takes you to the login screen and from there you have to navigate to the signup screen to finish the registration process.

I was also solving some problems in hackerrank and one in particular that I was doing with one of my mentors that we solved relatively quickly using several if statements, he asked me to solve it using only an if to reduce something called cyclomatic complexity which is a measure that gives a value that refers to the logical complexity of the code block you are evaluating.

Going back to the phase of building something from scratch, personally I liked it a lot, I felt that we applied all the teachings of the first phase, which were mostly softskills for teamwork and some other good practices at work on a personal level. I feel like I learned quite a bit about the parts that make up a project and how they interact with each other to make it work. Also what is it like to work with a client and how to receive the idea that he has and translate it into an app that is ultimately to his liking and with all the requirements that he asked for.
