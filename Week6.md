# Week 6

## Git

In previous weeks we had our Git section, and the concept is clear to me, but it is 100% proven that it is better understood in practice. Git was quite useful to me throughout this week, now I have learned to value the use that can be given. My colleagues and I have been using it to work on the same code. I mostly used it when I made a mistake and had no idea how to solve it to go back in time to when my code did work and see what happened.

#### Useful commands:

  `git status`  `git log`  `git branch -r <branch>`  `git checkout <branch>`  `git commit -m "description"`  `git push`  `git pull`  
  `git reset --hard <commit>`
