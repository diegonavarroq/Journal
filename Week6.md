# Week 6

This is the second week of the building something from scratch phase, it was a lot more technical than the previous one, because we started to build the application based on user stories and customer descriptions. Something new for me was working together with 6 other people and trying to build something that fits perfectly with the other 6 parts, honestly a challenge for me to be communicating with so many people inside and outside the team. Besides being learning almost everything I have to do since it is my first time almost in everything.

## Git

In previous weeks we had our Git section, and the concept is clear to me, but it is 100% proven that it is better understood in practice. Git was quite useful to me throughout this week, now I have learned to value the use that can be given. My colleagues and I have been using it to work on the same code. I mostly used it when I made a mistake and had no idea how to solve it to go back in time to when my code did work and see what happened.

#### Useful commands:

  `git status`  `git log`  `git branch -r <branch>`  `git checkout <branch>`  `git commit -m "description"`  `git push`  `git pull`  
  `git reset --hard <commit>` 

 ## React Native
 
 A JavaScript framework that suited us very well for some of the goals of this project. One of these is that the application has to be native for Android and IOS and react native makes applications that run natively on mobile devices with a performance similar to those that are actually developed natively. It is quite easy and fast to understand how this framework works, the best thing is that when you save the file you are working on you instantly see the changes in the simulator.
 
#### Good characteristics:

- Cross-platform
- Native Functionality
- Easy to learn
- Need smaller teams
- Easy data flow

 ## Expo
 
 Expo is a framework that involves react native, it was very useful this week to me as a beginner in application development, it has some limitations, but for the application requirements so far it has suited us very well. Onboarding is very fast if you can call it that from this framework. It is possible to run the application you are developing from the computer in a simulator, in the browser or if you download the expo application on your own mobile device.
 
 #### The command I've used the most so far in my entire life:
 
  `expo run:ios`

## React Native Style

During this week it is what I have been using every day to give a good presentation to the components of the UX / UI, by the way, at the moment I am developing part of the frontend. Since I had never worked on the front end of something, I have been told that it is very similar to how CSS works. Style seemed quite intuitive, easy to learn, and organize to make it a cleaner and more understandable code for others. CSS works in a separate file and style does not.


## Communication

Effective communication within a team is necessary and having each team member well informed about what the others are doing and why they are doing it is even more necessary for each one to do their job as a team. It is notorious when a team is not well informed about the work of their colleagues and this can affect the trust that the client has in us. So it is crucial for me to use these daily standups to inform your colleagues in a brief but efficient way about what you are doing and why you are doing it, this also gives you a broader perspective of your work, since it is not a whole but a block that belongs to something bigger that your team is working to achieve.
