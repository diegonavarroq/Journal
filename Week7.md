# Week 7

## Learnings of the week

Another week full of work, but, unlike last week, this was more about review than learning. I kept learning some things from react native, most of them were things that you only learn on the fly, some little specific details. 

This week I used a library called native-base, it is a component library that made it too easy for me to build the screens and the small details that I did throughout this week. To put them in context last week I was only using react-native, not bad, but with native-base it is much easier to arrange the components on the screen. These are the components that I have been using the most to organize the components: 

- HStack - accommodate components horizontally. 

- VStack - accommodate components vertically. 

- ZStack - arrange components on the z axis. 

I also used a library called react-native-chart-kit that is for graphing data, I struggled a bit to implement it because the explanation of how it is used was somewhat austere, but at the end of the day I could. With this library you fill an array with the data you want to graph, import the type of chart you want and voila, the only thing you have to do is add the style of your preference.

One of my colleagues who is developing the Backend showed me the requests that are made with an application called Postman. It works to visualize how the requests and responses that the FronEnd makes and receives would be. It is to validate that everything works correctly without having to connect the Frontend with the BackEnd from a graphical interface. I also saw how different systems use the APIs to communicate with each other without having to know how the other system works, it is very common for information to be passed in the form of JSON files, which just a few weeks ago we saw that one of my mentors and I.

It is a very important softskill to know how to communicate with the client without the need to use technical language, there are some who will understand it, but the vast majority will not, then it is necessary to have that ability to be able to understand someone else's ideas in a more normal language for so to speak, otherwise it seems that the broken phone is being played with ideas that are not 100% understood. And this is where it affects delivery times because you do not realize that what you are doing is wrong until you show it to the client and this causes you to do it again or in the best case only correct some details .

Just today we presented a demo for the client, it turned out better than last time but there are always some details to refine and things to learn from these presentations. Like what to say, what to commit to, things you are working on that may be better not show it to the client because it can be misunderstandings. It is very important to be able to see what you are going to be able to finish and what not in the specified period of time, in this case it is a very short period of time and not choosing well what to deliver at the end can lead you to not deliver anything what it is worse.
