# Week 5

This week was a special one, I got assign to a team inside the apprentice to develop an internal project, most of the time went on meetings in which my team and I receive all the specs from the client who want this project. This week was more about understanding than learning because to make a project for someone else you have to fully understand it first. Due to the specifications of the project, I had to read and do a lot of research about react native, which I had never done before. I did the environment setup on my computer and started to practice a bit with JSX. 

Can’t say anything specific about the project but here we go with a few learnings I had this week: 

## Clean code 

Every code should have these 3 characteristics: 

- Maintainable: Every software will require changes and general maintenance over time and clean code could help with that. Rember that in a company you’re not the only person that manipulates the same piece of code. 

- Easier troubleshooting: Sometimes software can have unintended behavior due to a variety of factors, it is important to resolve these behaviors as soon as possible. Clean code will help you to make code that is easy to navigate to resolve these problems. 

- Faster onboarding: Getting back to the part that you’re not the only one that will touch your code, that’s why is important that everyone can understand it as fast as possible to keep productivity high.

## Types of Mobile Apps

### Native app 
Build specifically for a mobile device's specific operating system.


| Pros        | Cons        |
| :---        |     ----:   |
| Faster    | Single platform     |
| Better performance   | Expensive    |
| Interact with device utilities   | Hard to maintain       |

### Web Apps
Similar to native apps but are accessed vie the web browser.


| Pros        | Cons        |
| :---        |     ----:   |
| Easy to build    | Need a browser     |
| For all platforms   | Less interactive    |
| Users don't use storage   | Needs internet connection       |

### Hybrid Apps
Web apps that look and feel like native apps.


| Pros        | Cons        |
| :---        |     ----:   |
| Easy to build    | Slower than native apps     |
| Cheaper than native apps   | Less interactive    |
| Can access device utilities   | More expensive than web apps  |


## Agile Practices
Agile practices could be useful in everything, not only in software development, it sounds more like a mixture of self-improvement and software development, that if you leave aside software development can work in other disciplines. 

### Conclusion
The trial ended up being small but I suppose that some weeks it will be like that, it does not mean that it was a light week but quite the opposite, it was a week of planning and understanding on how things have to be done in this new phase of the apprentice. I'm pretty sure that next week's learnings will be quite fat and technical due to the start of the project, stay tuned.
