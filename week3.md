# Week 3: Fancy Topics

## [The Future of Programming](https://vimeo.com/71278954) 

A talk with a touch of comedy and sarcasm from a point of view of the past seeing how computer science evolves. The main idea that I am left with from this talk is that people are quite resistant to change, even if it is for the better, we prefer to stay with what we are already "comfortable" because of the fact that we already know it perfectly. We should take the time to see what can be improved and what can be created that makes the place where you are a better place. This conference uses the history of programming to make us see those changes and new technologies, as strange as they may seem, have to be given a chance, there will always be resistance to new ideas and ways of thinking. Because to do this you have to stop thinking in one way and learn to think in another, something that is difficult, but ends up being for the better. You have to understand that nothing is finished to think otherwise is to stay stuck in the past like those programmers who thought it inconceivable to stop programming in binary to give the assembler a chance. Anyway, you have to be open-minded before giving a resounding no to the new. 


## [Moonshot Thinking ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cA_8IO3vbFs&ab_channel=GoogleWorkspace)
It is a type of thinking that focuses on seeing big problems and trying to solve them in a radical or unusual way. This means that work teams do not consider the impossible as an option. The most likely thing that happens during this process is that attempts to solve problems fail, so these failures should be taken as learning opportunities and not as something that discourages you. You have to take risks, risks are necessary and failure is also necessary. 

“We choose to go to the moon. We choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy but because they are hard. " -President John F. Kennedy 

Recipe for moonshots:
1. A huge problem in the world that affects millions or billions of people. 
2. A radical, sci-fi sounding solution that may seem impossible today. 
3. A technology breakthrough that may give us a glimmer of hope that the solution could be possible in the next 5-10 years.

## [La Mejor Presentación de Tu Vida](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0s6ZLkV-U0&ab_channel=EnricLlad%C3%B3) 
They are important since most of the time no one is paying attention to you, you are just doing your thing, but when you are exposing all the attention is on you then they will most likely remember. Within a presentation you have to make people think and feel what you are presenting. 

**Keys for a good presentation:**
- Bring something useful and new. 
- Less is more, simplify. 
- Give it shape and order in a structure. 
- Encourage participation. 
- Use evocative language.
- Set the pace.

**The best presentation of your life is the next one, because you always have to try to make it better than the previous one.**


## [Quantum Computers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhHMJCUmq28&ab_channel=Kurzgesagt%E2%80%93InaNutshell)
The Split experiment seemed to me the most curious and strange, even something difficult to believe that it actually happened how it is possible that a particle that is an inanimate object behaves differently depends on whether you are seeing it or not. Personally, I already had some knowledge of quantum computers because I had done my own research a few years ago. About two years ago I did a marathon of all the Kurzgesagt videos and one of the ones that caught my attention the most was that of quantum computers and how extremely powerful they are going to be, I honestly still do not fully understand why this is subject in the apprentice, maybe so that we can get an idea of the future of computers or just to have a little general knowledge about new technologies. 

If Einstein affirmed with certainty that nobody understood quantum mechanics that means that sometimes it is okay not to understand the topics in their entirety, at least he understands the topic for what you need it.


## [Testing](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/UnitTest.html)
Testing the code during the development process seems like a good practice to me, that ensures a quality and highly optimized code. For an apprentice it should be a very good habit to make quality code from the beginning and readable for others in case that code is necessary to work as a team. One of the practices that I already did is to write easy code and already finished the program, to do a rebilling of all the code and to be constantly compiling it to make sure that it continued to behave in the same way. These procedures are 100% necessary, personally the one that most catches my attention is the UnitTest, which consists of testing small units of code independently of the rest in order to verify their correct operation. 


## [Vim](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/2020/editors/)
I had never heard of Vim, now I know that it is the most efficient and intuitive text editor and highly customizable to your preferences and needs. I read that it even gives you super powers as a programmer, it looks quite promising in terms of improving productivity, but, the only thing I see is the amount of time and practice necessary to really use it in an efficient way, and with the apprentice on top it is a bit difficult for me to be learning everything and then add learning Vim to it, at the moment I think that it would only slow me down when editing code and right now it is something that I cannot afford, but when I have the freer agenda I will dedicate some time to it.


## [Git](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/2020/version-control/)
I had never used Git until a couple of weeks ago when one of my mentors suggested it as a topic in one of our meetings, it's a pretty useful tool when you're doing pair programming. What I did when I needed to make major modifications to some code, I copied all the code and saved it in a .txt file and that was my version control, my method quite prehistoric, right? So, this class on Git was quite useful, especially all the commands and a little about the operation that it explains.
